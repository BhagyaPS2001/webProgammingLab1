            Client: When we talk the word Client, it mean to talk of a person or an organization using a particular
            service.
            Similarly in the digital world a Client is a computer (Host) i.e. capable of receiving information or using
            a
            particular service from the service providers (Servers).<br><br>
            Servers: Similarly, when we talk the word Servers, It mean a person or medium that serves something.
            Similarly
            in this digital world a Server is a remote computer which provides information (data) or access to
            particular
            services.

            Any web application, big or small, contains these major components:
            <br><br>
            View Layer:- When you consider an MVC application, the View layer component gives an interface to the
            application. Regardless if it is for users with a browser or for another application using Web services.
            View
            layer is the bridge for getting the data in and out of the application.
            <br><br>
            It does not have business logic, like calculating interest for a banking application or storing items in a
            shopping cart for an online catalog. It also does not contain any code for existing data to or retrieving
            data
            from a data source. Business logic is managed by the Model layer. View layer is more focused on the
            interface.
            <br><br>
            Business Layer:- It is also known as Business Logic or Domain Logic or Application Layer. The function of
            the
            business layer is to accept user requests from the browser, processes them, and determine the routes through
            which the data will be accessed. The workflows by which the data and requests travel through the back end
            lay
            encoded in a business layer.
            <br><br>
            Data Access Layer:- This layer is built to keep the code you use to pull data from your data store like
            database, flat files, or web services separate from business logic and presentation code. So even if you
            have to
            change data stores, you don’t end up rewriting the whole thing.

            Web content is the textual, visual, or aural content that is encountered as part of the user experience on
            websites. It may include—among other things—text, images, sounds, videos, and animations.

        <h2>HTTP - HTTP request </h2>

        <p>
            HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is invented by Tim Berner. HyperText is the type of text
            which
            is specially coded with the help of some standard coding language called as HyperText Markup Language
            (HTML).
            HTTP/2 is latest version of HTTP, which was published on May 2015.
            <br><br>
            The protocols that are used to transfer hypertext between two computers is known as HyperText Transfer
            Protocol.

            First of all, whenever we want to open any website then first we open web browser after that we will type
            URL of
            that website (e.g., www.facebook.com ). This URL is now sent to Domain Name Server (DNS). Then DNS first
            check
            records for this URL in their database, then DNS will return IP address to web browser corresponding to this
            URL. Now browser is able to sent request to actual server.
